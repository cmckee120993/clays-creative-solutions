## Description

This is my personal website and portfolio of all of my work experiences, publications, and clients. For the time being, it is used to show my clients what I do and what my rates are. The site is available in French and English. There are multiple ways to contact me, explore my offers, or even look at my experiences that can be utilized by my clients. Not only does the site serve as portfolio/résumé, it also is an example of the quality code and services I provide to clients. 

Future developments for the site include: 
- A blog of articles related to literature, writing, translation, web development, and marketing
- Creation of accounts to engage in an online community through the blog
- Translation into Spanish and Arabic

## Deployment

Developments for this site can be followed on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/cmckee120993/clays-creative-solutions).

The live site for Clay's Creative Solutions can be found [at this link](https://clayscreativesolutions.com/).

## Creation

The current live site was created using React, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I used flexbox to make the site responsive and I followed accessibility standards in my code. All of the logos and photos were designed/edited by me using the Adobe Suite. 

Future development of the site will turn this React applicaiton into a full MERN stack application. The database will be created using MongoDB, Node.js and Express are used to create and connect the server to React, and the page will continue to be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
